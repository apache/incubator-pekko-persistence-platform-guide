# Apache Pekko Platform Guide

## Review and feedback

This is the repository for the Apache Pekko Platform Guide and we would love to hear your feedback.

Feel free to give your feedback in the form of issues/PRs.

## Status

The code in this repo has been changed to use Pekko libs instead of Akka/Alpakka. The docs themselves still need to be updated. The [Akka Guide](https://developer.lightbend.com/docs/akka-guide/) should still be a reasonably good intro still.
